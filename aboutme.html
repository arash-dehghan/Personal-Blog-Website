	<!-- The 'header' tag/element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. Usually don't want to have links that go to different websites (Ex: Twitter, etc.) in the 'header' tag. More for internal links. I'm using it for my navigation bar on this website. -->
		<div class = "container">
		<!--The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. Web developers use <div> elements to group together HTML elements and apply CSS styles to many elements at once. For instance, by wrapping a set of paragraph elements into a <div> element, the developer can take advantage of CSS styles and apply a font to all paragraphs at once by applying a font style to the <div> tag instead of coding the same style for each paragraph element. -->
		<!--You should uses classes instead of id's when you want to apply certain style to multiple HTML elements. For example, lets say you have a <div class = "boldandcolorred"> which using CSS makes everything in the class bold and having a font colour of red, then anytime you assign any paragprah or anything inside this div to this class, it will automatically be set to those styles we originally set. However, ID's on the other hand are unique. Meaning that you should set a unique ID for every element on your page. Each ID has unqiue stylings set specifically for that element. Important to note that it is important for JavaScript which one you use, so use them appropriately. Check out this website for more information https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/  -->
		<!--Next I am defining our logo class, where we are giving it certain stylings in our header/navigation bar. Using a class since we might want to use the logo again later. -->

				<p>
				I am this cat. Pretty impressive that I made this website now, huh? This is where I would usually try to write some white lies about myself to try to impress the reader and kind've hype myself up. Instead, I'm just going to pretend to be this random feline.
				<p>Here is the second paragraph. The lies continue on. I'm trying to think of things to say so I can fill a couple paragraphs to make this section a bit more "meaty" so it's not just a 1000x1000 picture of a cat and like three sentences. Again, me, or whoever I'm making the website for, would fill this section with interesting informtaion about themselves that readers would want to know. For example; how many kids do you have? Where are you from? Are you really a cat? Maybe it's time for a third paragraph.
				<p>Finally, this section might also contain like a contact form of some sorts maybe. Where they can try to reach you with oppertunities. It should be simple and easy to use. The form should ideally make them fill out their name, email, and then their message they'd like to leave you. It should send you an email with all of their information, including the message they left you, and then you can decide if you'd like to respond to them. Maybe ask them for money because you're poor. Who knows. Anyways, it could also work by using the side navigation/social media bar, where they would click on the email icon, and the form would pop out. That would also be an option. I just need a couple more sentences here I think and then I'll stop. I hope no one copyrights this picture of this cat. Usually I would just put my own photo there and try to make it look very professional. Alright, that's all I have, thank you for reading. This was "about me".
